# Team-Escape
Here's my very own Gacha game. I uploaded the code
on GitHub so I could keep everything as a backup
and as a way to use it as a reference when I need
help.

# Rules
- Please do not take this entire project, publish it
and claim it as your own thing. It's my very own
project and I put a lot of sweat and tears in it.
- Please do not mess things up with this project
and upload/change things without my permission.

# The usages for the github project
- A backup for the project.
- An easy way to seek help and keep track of
everything.
- A way to keep my project tidy, put programming
tasks and goals.
- beta testing/early access (in the future).
